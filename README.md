# Redux Shopping Cart


A [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) example application in the form of an online store with a shopping cart.

This app uses TypeScript and demonstrates how to get strong test coverage.

It was created as the source material for my egghead.io course on RTK and TypeScript.

This app uses https://vitejs.dev/ to power its dev mode.
